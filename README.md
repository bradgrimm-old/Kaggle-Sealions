# Kaggle-Sealions

Kaggle has an online competition to keep track of Sea Lion populations. The competition can be found here:

This code is simply my musings on the competition. You can see my Kaggle profile here:

The requirements.txt has the current set of libraries I've installed. Though admittedly, many of them may simply be required for other projects I've been messing with.

The data is not included and should be downloaded from Kaggle.
